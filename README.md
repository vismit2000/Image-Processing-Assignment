Assignment submitted in the course (CS F311) Image Processing at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus in 2019-20.

### Contents

- `low_pass_filter.m`: MATLAB file containing code for low-pass filtering in Fourier domain with a square filter with D0 = 25 pixels i.e. side of the square filter function (H(u,v)) = 50 pixels.

- `input.bmp`: input image

- `output.png`: image after applying the low pass filter
