# Image Processing in MATLAB

Assignments submitted in the course (CS F311) Image Processing at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus in 2019-20.

## Assignment-1: Low-pass Filtering in Fourier Domain

- `low_pass_filter.m`: MATLAB file containing code for low-pass filtering in Fourier domain with a square filter with D0 = 25 pixels i.e. side of the square filter function (H(u,v)) = 50 pixels

- `input.bmp`: input image

- `output.png`: image after applying the low pass filter

## Assignment-2: Image Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

- `DCT_Image_Compression.m`: MATLAB file containing code for DCT_Image_Compression.m showing application of DCT to the image *cameraman.tif*

- Contains *original image*, *reconstructed image* after lossy compression and *error image* showing absolute error during transformation
